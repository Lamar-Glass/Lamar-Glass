# 👋 Hi, I'm Lamar Glass

I'm a self-taught aspiring AI engineer from Kenya, committed to mastering the full stack of Artificial Intelligence — from foundational theory to advanced engineering and deployment.

## 🚀 My Journey: AI Science + Engineering (2025–2026)

Starting August 1, 2025, I’ve embarked on an 18-month intensive self-study program focused on:

🧠 **AI Science** (Theory & Math)  
🛠️ **AI Engineering** (Systems & Deployment)  
📈 **Real-World Projects** (Portfolio Development)
