About Me
I’m Lamar Glass, a self-taught aspiring AI Engineer from Kenya, currently undertaking an intensive 18-month learning journey (August 2025 – January 2027) to gain expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.

My learning path covers:

Python programming and data analysis

Mathematics for AI, including linear algebra, calculus, and statistics

Building real-world applications with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch

MLOps practices for deploying and maintaining AI models in production

I dedicate 30+ hours each week to studying, coding, and documenting my progress while developing a portfolio of end-to-end AI projects.

My ultimate goal is to evolve into a professional AI Engineer capable of designing and delivering innovative, intelligent, and impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.
