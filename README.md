I’m Lamar Glass, a self-taught aspiring AI Engineer from Kenya, currently on an 18-month journey (Aug 2025 – Jan 2027) to master artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. My focus spans Python programming, data analysis, mathematics for AI, and building real-world applications using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I’m also learning MLOps tools for deploying models to production. I dedicate over 30 hours weekly to studying, coding, and documenting my progress, while actively building a portfolio of end-to-end AI projects. My goal is to grow into a professional AI Engineer capable of creating impactful and intelligent solutions.
